        Hello! My name is Ian Paul. I was born in the suburbs of Philadelphia
        and took an early interest in math and programming, which continued throughout
        my K-12 years, into college where I studied Computer Science at Cornell University,
        and now into my present and presumably my future. The most important product of my
        college years has undoubtedly been the persistent interest in
        education and intellectual growth the University instilled in me.

        To see evidence of such, please visit my other pages
        to take a look at the high-quality (by my standards, for what that is worth)
        sources that I have absorb(ed) information from and have been great aids in my journey of
        learning about probability theory, trading, financial market microstructure, and
        financial engineering in a broad sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        On a personal note, when I am not reading something or working, I am spending time with my partner and/or our
        rescue
        dacschund, walking through parks, drinking expensive coffee, exploring the best food spots the city of New York
        has to
        offer, playing board games, listening to a wide (in my opinion) variety of music, or watching movies.
        I have linked to some of my favorite games on my home page.
      </p>
